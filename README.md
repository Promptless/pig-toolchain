# Promptless PIG Toolchain

This repository is the canonical public toolchain for Promptless Instruction
Hub repositories. It bundles the Python compiler and exposes reusable GitHub
workflows, a GitLab CI template, and a composite GitHub Action for validating,
building, and publishing generated hub artifacts.

## Usage

Use the [GitHub workflows](#github-actions) or [GitLab template](#gitlab-ci) to
keep toolchain setup in this repository. For custom GitHub jobs, see
[direct action usage](#direct-action-usage).

### GitHub Actions

Add these two caller files to your hub repository. They use GitHub's
[reusable workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows),
with `uses` on the job. The shared workflows handle checkout and toolchain setup.

`.github/workflows/instruction-hub-check.yml`:

```yaml
name: Check Instruction Hub

on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  instruction-hub:
    uses: Promptless/pig-toolchain/.github/workflows/pr-check.yml@main
```

`.github/workflows/instruction-hub-publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish Instruction Hub

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

concurrency:
  group: instruction-hub-release
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  instruction-hub:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    uses: Promptless/pig-toolchain/.github/workflows/publish.yml@main
    with:
      source-branch: main
```

The [check workflow](.github/workflows/pr-check.yml) validates and builds the hub
without committing generated files. The [publish workflow](.github/workflows/publish.yml)
publishes generated artifacts to `release/stable` and updates marketplace
pointers on the source branch for the configured Claude, Codex, and Cursor targets.
The caller above runs publication on pushes to `main` or manual runs on `main`,
and its concurrency group prevents overlapping publish runs.

Publishing uses the caller repository's automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no additional
secret is required. Grant `contents: write` as shown and ensure repository rules
allow that token to push to both the source and release branches.

All workflow inputs are optional. Set them under the calling job's `with`:

| Input | Workflow | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hub-root` | Both | `.` | Hub directory within the checked-out repository. |
| `mode` | Check | `build` | Use `check` only when generated artifacts are committed alongside source. |
| `source-branch` | Publish | `main` | Branch allowed to publish and receive marketplace pointer updates. |
| `release-branch` | Publish | `release/stable` | Branch that receives generated artifacts; must differ from `source-branch`. |

If your source branch is not `main`, update `push.branches`, the job's `if`, and
`source-branch` together. For a hub in a subdirectory, set `hub-root` in both
callers.

Use `@main` in both workflow references to follow the latest merged toolchain.
Each reusable workflow checks out the compiler using the ref in its
caller's `uses`; there is no separate `toolchain-ref` input on GitHub.

### GitLab CI

For a hub at the repository root, add this to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
include:
  - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Promptless/pig-toolchain/main/templates/gitlab/instruction-hub.yml
```

The [template](templates/gitlab/instruction-hub.yml) validates and builds hub
changes in merge requests. Default-branch pushes that change hub source or CI
configuration publish to `release/stable` and update the Claude, Codex, and Cursor
marketplace pointers. Manually started pipelines validate on every branch and
also publish on the default branch. Publishing is serialized, skips superseded
hub source, and includes pointer commits from earlier jobs before pushing.

Use a Linux runner that supports `image:`. Enable **Settings > CI/CD > Job token
permissions > Allow Git push requests to the repository** in the consuming
project. The user starting the pipeline must be allowed to push to the default
and release branches. Publishing uses `CI_JOB_TOKEN`; its pushes do not trigger
another pipeline. No GitHub token is needed.

The template scopes its image and variables to its own jobs. All inputs are
optional and go under the remote include's `inputs`:

| Input | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `toolchain-ref` | `main` | Leave as `main` to use the latest merged compiler. |
| `release-branch` | `release/stable` | Branch that receives generated artifacts; must differ from the default branch. |
| `check-stage` | `test` | Existing pipeline stage for validation. |
| `publish-stage` | `deploy` | Existing pipeline stage for publishing. |

For a pipeline with custom stages, use `include:inputs`:

```yaml
stages: [verify, publish]
include:
  - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Promptless/pig-toolchain/main/templates/gitlab/instruction-hub.yml
    inputs:
      check-stage: verify
      publish-stage: publish
      release-branch: release/stable
```

The compiler defaults to `main`: each job fetches the latest merged toolchain
when it starts and logs the resolved commit for diagnostics. Keep both the
remote template URL and `toolchain-ref` on `main`. The template runs the same `scripts/run.sh` entrypoint as the
GitHub Action, with GitLab workspace, repository, identity, and branch checks
supplied by the template.

### Direct action usage

Use the [composite action](action.yml) in a custom GitHub job when you need its
additional inputs, such as generated paths or marketplace pointer controls.
This publish job belongs in a workflow triggered from your source branch:

```yaml
jobs:
  instruction-hub:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: Promptless/pig-toolchain@main
        with:
          mode: publish
          source-branch: main
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
```

Keep `fetch-depth: 0` for publication and pass the token as shown when checkout
credentials are not persisted. Use `@main` for the latest merged action and
compiler.

The action runs the bundled compiler directly:

```bash
uv run --project "$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH" promptless-instruction-hub <command>
```

### Local verification

Before publishing a source change, run the full non-mutating compilation:

```bash
pig verify --hub .
```

`pig verify` validates every stable asset and renders every stable plugin for
every configured target in an ephemeral directory. It does not create, update,
or compare generated files in the source worktree, whether verification
succeeds or fails. Use `pig build --check` instead when the repository
intentionally commits generated artifacts and must prove they are current.

## Development

Run the full test suite in parallel:

```bash
uv run pytest tests -n auto --dist worksteal
```

Omit the parallel flags when running a single test file or a `-k` selection.

## Marketplace and plugin identities

`hub.yaml` declares the marketplace's literal ID and display name:

```yaml
org: Promptless
marketplace:
  id: promptless-instruction-hub
  name: Promptless Instruction Hub
version: 0.1.0
stable_plugins: [pig, dev]
targets: [claude, codex, gemini, cursor]
```

Each file in `plugins/*.yaml` defines one plugin, using its own literal ID:

```yaml
# plugins/dev.yaml
id: dev
name: Promptless Dev
includes:
  - skill:review-docs
```

The skill in this example must exist in `assets/skills/review-docs/`. Keep the
required `plugins/pig.yaml` created by `pig init` in `stable_plugins`.

The compiler uses `marketplace.id` as the marketplace name and each plugin's
`id` as its native name. It adds no prefix or suffix. IDs use lowercase letters,
digits, and hyphens, with a letter or digit at each end. Plugin display names
come from `name` where the target supports them. Authored plugin output goes to
`dist/{target}/{plugin.id}/`. Gemini receives extensions with the same plugin
IDs; it has no generated marketplace manifest.

`pig init --org Acme` defaults to marketplace ID `acme-instruction-hub` and
display name `Acme Instruction Hub`. Override those with `--marketplace-id` and
`--marketplace-name`. `version` is the hub release version shared by all compiled
plugins. Publication compares generated output at the previous release version:
changed output advances the patch version, while unchanged output keeps it.
Set a higher `version` in `hub.yaml` to request a specific release, such as a
minor or major bump. Publication never lowers the version.

The publisher writes the resolved version back to `hub.yaml` and commits it
with the source marketplace pointers. It pushes the source and release commits
in one atomic Git transaction with explicit leases on both branch revisions.
If either branch changes during the build, or either update is rejected, neither
publish update lands. Rerun from the latest source branch after a race. The Git
server must support atomic pushes, and the publisher needs write access to both
branches. Publish requires committed source files and a clean index.

An unchanged rerun creates no commits. If only one branch needs a content change,
the other receives an empty recording commit so Git checks both leases. Merely
writing the resolved version back does not cause another version bump.

### External plugins

A Hub can distribute upstream plugins for Claude, Codex, and Cursor. Set
`source.ref` to a full 40-character commit SHA for a fixed pin, or `"latest"`
to follow the upstream default branch when the Hub publishes.

```yaml
# plugins/doc-detective.yaml
kind: external
id: doc-detective
name: Doc Detective
source:
  type: git
  url: https://github.com/doc-detective/agent-tools.git
  ref: "latest"
targets:
  claude:
    path: plugins/doc-detective
  codex:
    path: plugins/doc-detective
  cursor:
    path: plugins/doc-detective
```

Add the ID to `hub.yaml`'s `stable_plugins`. It must match the upstream manifest's
`name`. Declare only targets the upstream supports; paths are relative to its
repository, with `.` for a plugin at the root.

Verify the upstream plugin and local build:

```bash
pig resolve-external --hub .
pig verify --hub .
```

For `"latest"`, commit the generated `hub.external-plugins.lock.json` alongside
the definition. Offline builds use this lock; CI build and publish modes refresh
it. Catalog definitions use `ref`; locks, release provenance, and marketplaces
use the resolved `sha`. Consumers update installed plugins through their host.

The generated PIG plugin includes an
[`add-external-plugin` skill](src/promptless_instruction_hub/managed_skill_assets/add-external-plugin/shared/SKILL.md)
with instructions for verification, updates, rollback, private repositories,
and host compatibility.

When an authored plugin replaces an external Claude plugin, the resolved Hub
release version must differ from the previous upstream version. If the automatic
bump collides, choose a higher version with
`pig set-version --hub . --version <new-version>` before publishing.

### Migrating existing hubs

This is a breaking source configuration and installed plugin identity change.
Coordinate the toolchain upgrade with the hub migration. Validation rejects
legacy fields and the old `packages/` directory with migration guidance.

1. Replace root `plugin_id` and `plugin_name` with `marketplace.id` and
   `marketplace.name`. To keep an existing marketplace registration, set the new
   ID to its previous generated name: the old `plugin_id` plus `-marketplace`.
   The compiler now uses that value verbatim.
2. Move `packages/` to `plugins/` and rename `stable_packages` to
   `stable_plugins` in `hub.yaml`. Keep each definition's `id`, `name`, and
   `includes`. Update custom CI path filters and scripts that reference the old
   directory or `pig init --plugin-id` / `--plugin-name` flags.
3. Rename `plugin_version` to `version` in `hub.yaml` and use `--version`
   instead of `--plugin-version` in scripts. Version 2 release manifests use
   top-level `version`, `marketplace`, `stable_plugins`, and `version_basis.plugins`.
   Version 1 manifests are rejected. Coordinate a one-time rebuild of existing
   release artifacts with the source migration before resuming publication.
4. Run `pig verify --hub .`, then publish using the upgraded toolchain.
5. Refresh the marketplace and replace installed plugins using their new IDs.
   For example, `promptless-instruction-hub-dev` becomes `dev`. Remove the old
   installation so its skills and hooks are not loaded alongside the new one.
   An updater cannot infer that these different plugin IDs are replacements.

To distinguish plugins from multiple hubs in a host that uses plugin names as
skill namespaces, choose explicit IDs such as `acme-dev` for customer plugins.
The compiler never adds that prefix automatically. The managed PIG plugin
continues to require the ID `pig`.

`hub.release.json` and `hub.stable.json` share a schema version (2 for authored-only
releases, 3 when external plugins are selected) and the same top-level `version`.
Runtime enrollment metadata still uses `plugin_version`
for the installed plugin's version and `package_id` for the source plugin ID.
Runtime `plugin_id` matches the literal ID in the native plugin manifest.

## Modes

- `build`: validate the hub and run a build without committing generated files.
- `check`: validate the hub and fail if committed generated output is stale.
- `publish`: build generated output from `source-branch` and atomically update
  the release branch together with the source version and marketplace pointers.

Customer hubs should usually use `build` for pull requests and `publish` after
changes merge to the default branch. Use `check` only for repositories that
intentionally commit generated artifacts on the same branch as source assets.

Cursor source-branch pointers use the existing `type: github` descriptor for
`github.com`. Other hosts, including GitLab, use a `git-subdir` source with the
repository URL, plugin path, and release branch. This preserves GitLab subgroup
paths and supports hubs inside a repository subdirectory. Release-branch Cursor
marketplaces continue to use relative plugin paths.

GitLab CI adapters should map `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` to `CI_SERVER_URL` and
`GITHUB_REPOSITORY` to `CI_PROJECT_PATH`. `INPUT_UPDATE_CURSOR_POINTER` enables
the GitLab pointer writer. Keep `INPUT_GITHUB_TOKEN` unset and use GitLab checkout
credentials for publishing.

Cursor advertises GitLab imports through its
[team marketplaces](https://cursor.com/changelog/customize). Manifest generation
does not verify that import path: Cursor needs its own repository access, and
some desktop importers still reject GitLab URLs. Verify installation and refresh
through the team's GitLab-capable importer before relying on Cursor delivery.

Every hub must keep the canonical `pig` plugin in `stable_plugins`. `pig init`
scaffolds that plugin as the home for scanned shared instructions and the
optional Promptless-managed lifecycle integration. Other customer instruction plugins
do not receive managed hooks or runtime files.

## Hub File Layout

Instruction Hub source config lives at `hub.yaml` in the hub root. Build-generated
release metadata is also flat at the hub root:

- `hub.release.json`: current release manifest.
- `hub.stable.json`: stable channel pointer.

Scan-generated metadata is committed as a root file:

- `hub.repo-context.json`: scanned repository-context inventory.

Native Cursor rules can be authored as `assets/rules/<id>.mdc` with a matching
`<id>.asset.yaml` sidecar declaring `support.cursor.mode: native`. The compiler
preserves existing rule frontmatter, including `description`, `globs`, and
`alwaysApply`. Rules without frontmatter receive the generated description and
`alwaysApply: false` defaults.

Every generated plugin embeds local metadata as root files inside each plugin:

- `hub.release.json`: plugin-local release/status manifest.
- `hub.managed-runtimes.json`: Promptless-managed runtime metadata for plugins
  that include managed-runtime artifacts.

### Portable commands

Keep an explicitly invoked workflow as `command:<id>` in a plugin's `includes`.
Author it in `assets/commands/<id>.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Rebase the current PR onto main and report the result.
---

Fetch the latest main, rebase the current PR branch, and resolve conflicts.
```

The compiler preserves the asset ID and the complete procedure. It chooses the
target's format and registers exactly one entry:

| Target | Generated file | Invocation control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | `agents/openai.yaml` sets `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` |
| Claude | `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | Frontmatter sets `disable-model-invocation: true` |
| Cursor | `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` | Frontmatter sets `disable-model-invocation: true` |
| Gemini | `commands/<id>.toml` | Native slash command |

For example, Codex gets `rebase-pr`, with its normal plugin namespace, instead of
the `source-command-rebase-pr` name produced by Codex's legacy command importer.
No additional Markdown command is emitted alongside a converted skill.
Release metadata still records `command:rebase-pr` as the source asset.

Commands without a `support` table default to native delivery on all hub targets.
An explicit table is an allowlist: omitted targets remain unsupported. Existing
`mode: native` command declarations now select conversion; explicit
`mode: unsupported` exclusions remain effective. For example:

```yaml
# assets/commands/rebase-pr.asset.yaml
support:
  claude:
    mode: native
  codex:
    mode: native
  cursor:
    mode: native
  gemini:
    mode: unsupported
    reason: Not enabled for this workflow.
```

Portable command frontmatter requires a nonempty `description` of at most 1,024
characters without angle-bracket invocation syntax. Optional `name` must match
the asset ID. Names are limited to 64 characters; Codex's combined
`plugin-id:command-id` must also fit that limit. Optional
`disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable` must be `true`: commands always
require explicit invocation. Use a skill asset for automatic selection.

Claude conversion also preserves `argument-hint`, `$ARGUMENTS`, `$ARGUMENTS[N]`,
and `$N`. Other targets reject these fields and substitutions. Portable workflows
can instead describe how to use the context supplied with the invocation. The
compiler rejects unsupported frontmatter, including `allowed-tools`, `model`,
and `context`, and host-specific dynamic context syntax such as shell injection,
Gemini `{{args}}` / `@{...}`, and Claude path variables. It does not silently drop
permissions, tool restrictions, subagent behavior, or template expansion.

For a command that needs host-specific features, set that target to
`mode: verbatim`. This copies a single native `.md` file for Claude/Cursor or a
native `.toml` file for Gemini, including its metadata and substitutions. Gemini
TOML must contain a nonempty `prompt` string. Codex has no native command format
in this contract; author a Codex skill asset for features outside conversion.
Directory command bundles are not supported by conversion or verbatim delivery.
The existing `projected` mode remains an inert Markdown projection, not a
registered, executable command.

Validation rejects command/skill invocation collisions within each plugin,
including converted agents and compiler-managed skills. Before adopting this
compiler, remove redundant command wrappers whose names already belong to a
skill, or give the workflows distinct names. Native files that previously used
`mode: native` and require unsupported syntax must switch to `mode: verbatim`.
After publishing, refresh the installed plugin and reload the harness to replace
cached command imports.

These adapters follow the documented invocation controls for
[Codex skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills),
[Claude skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills),
[Cursor skills](https://cursor.com/docs/skills), and
[Gemini custom commands](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/custom-commands/).
Artifact checks validate file formats, names, registration, and invocation
settings; installation, command-picker behavior, and refresh still need testing
in each supported harness version.

### Agent definitions as Codex skills

An agent can ship as a native Claude subagent and a Codex skill from the same
Markdown source. Set its adjacent `<id>.asset.yaml` file to:

```yaml
support:
  claude:
    mode: native
  codex:
    mode: agent-skill
```

Keep the `agent:<id>` reference in the plugin's `includes` list. The compiler
writes `skills/<id>/SKILL.md` into the Codex plugin and registers it as a skill.
Release metadata retains the source agent identity. Conversion is opt-in,
Codex-only, and accepts `.md` files; directory-based agents are not converted.

The generated skill contains the full authored procedure and instructions to
delegate it to one child. An assigned specialist executes the procedure directly
without delegating the same role again. The parent relays clarification questions
and answers, then returns the result. If subagent tools are unavailable, the
instructions require stopping. The model must follow these instructions; Codex has
no documented skill frontmatter that enforces subagent execution. See the
[Codex skill documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

Source frontmatter must have a nonempty `description` of at most 1,024 characters.
Use a shared portable description and put invocation examples in the body. The
generated skill name is the asset ID. Optional `name`, `model`, and `color` fields
are accepted; the generated skill omits model and color settings and tells the
parent to launch the child without model or reasoning overrides.

`tools` and `disallowedTools` accept comma-separated strings or YAML lists.
They become advisory instructions with their original tool names; the compiler
does not map names between hosts. An empty `tools` list means the specialist
must not use tools. `pig validate`, `pig verify`, and `pig build` print one warning
per included converted agent that declares either field. Codex does not enforce
these restrictions through skill metadata. Write required behavior in the shared
procedure without claiming that a host enforces it.

Conversion rejects other frontmatter fields, invalid descriptions, and skill
destination collisions, including names reserved for compiler-managed skills.
The compiler does not truncate descriptions or rewrite procedures.

The old `.promptless/instruction-hub.yaml` and generated `.promptless/...`
layout is not read or migrated by this toolchain. Existing hubs must rename
their config to `hub.yaml` and regenerate output with `pig build`.

## Release Model

Hubs follow the latest merged toolchain on `main`. GitHub callers use `@main`;
GitLab callers use the `/main/` template URL and the default `toolchain-ref: main`.
Resolved commit hashes in CI logs identify the compiler used for a build.

Releases containing external plugins use manifest schema 3 and record their
provenance in `version_basis.plugins`; authored-only releases use schema 2.
The publisher accepts both. Upgrade older toolchains before consuming schema 3
releases.

The publisher stores verified upstream versions in release-side
`hub.external.json`, bound to the release hash and exact source declarations.
Version comparisons use this record even if the old repository is unavailable.
Releases without this record require fetching the old pin.

## Authored hooks

Register `hook:<id>` in a plugin's includes. Keep its Python script and one
`asset.yaml` declaration in `assets/hooks/<id>/`. For example:

```yaml
support:
  claude: {mode: native}
  codex: {mode: native}
  cursor: {mode: native}
hook:
  entrypoint: run.py
  timeout: 75
  status_message: Checking credentials
  bindings:
    claude:
      - {event: PostToolUseFailure, matcher: Bash}
    codex:
      - {event: PostToolUse, matcher: Bash}
    cursor:
      - {event: postToolUseFailure, matcher: Shell}
```

The compiler generates the native JSON, plugin-root paths, Python 3.9+ prerequisite
check, and a shared input/output adapter. No installed toolchain package is needed
on the user's machine. Generated launchers use a POSIX shell. Entrypoints must be existing `.py` files inside the bundle;
unknown fields, invalid bindings, and conflicting definitions fail validation.
Changing the declaration changes the asset's content hash and release identity.

Bindings deliberately name native events: the compiler does not guess equivalent
triggers across harnesses. The portable adapter supports Claude's `SessionStart`,
`PostToolUse`, and `PostToolUseFailure`; Codex's `SessionStart` and `PostToolUse`;
and Cursor's `sessionStart`, `postToolUse`, and `postToolUseFailure`.
Bindings must cover exactly the targets marked `native` for this asset.

Scripts read one JSON object on stdin:

```json
{
  "event": "tool_result",
  "cwd": "/workspace/repo",
  "shell": {
    "command": "python helper.py",
    "output": "command output",
    "exit_code": 1,
    "status": "failed"
  }
}
```

`event` is `session_start` or `tool_result`. `shell` is null for startup and
non-shell tools. Its status is `success`, `failed`, `unknown`, `running`,
`cancelled`, `timeout`, or `permission_denied`. A missing exit code stays null;
in particular, Codex can emit raw output with an `unknown` status. Hooks must not
assume that unknown means failed. Cursor uses its reported cwd, falling back to
its first workspace root. A missing working directory remains null.

Emit `{"context": "Message for the agent"}` on stdout, or leave stdout empty to
stay quiet. Use stderr for diagnostics. The adapter wraps context in the native
response envelope and preserves a nonzero script exit. Scripts execute in the
adapter's process, so cancellation signals reach their handlers directly. The
adapter does not retry commands, start background workers, or infer recovery
policy; those decisions belong to the hook script.

### Native JSON escape hatch

For other events, runtimes, or host features, keep `hooks.<target>.json` and shared
scripts in the bundle instead of declaring `hook:` in `asset.yaml`. A shared
`hooks.json` is used when the target-specific file is absent. Mixing a portable
declaration with native JSON in one bundle is rejected; separate bundles can mix
freely within a plugin. Existing single-file JSON hooks and other legacy native
files remain supported.

The compiler copies bundles to `hooks/<id>/` and combines selected configurations
at `hooks/hooks.json`, appending handlers in asset-reference order, joining
descriptions, and rejecting conflicting top-level metadata. Native JSON must
contain a `hooks` object whose event values are arrays of handler objects. PIG's
managed lifecycle hooks are appended afterward when ingestion is enabled; other
plugins receive only their own hooks.

### Hub-owned behavioral tests

The shared PR workflow supports an optional test job. Configure it in the hub's
existing workflow alongside `hub-root`; keep the tests with their source assets:

```yaml
with:
  hub-root: .
  test-command: python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
  test-runs-on: macos-latest
  test-python-version: "3.9"
```

With no `test-command`, no test job runs. The default runner is `ubuntu-latest`
and the default Python version is `3.9`. The toolchain owns checkout, interpreter
setup, execution, and failure propagation. The hub owns the command and test
requirements; add its test paths to the workflow's PR filters. Test commands are
trusted repository code, run without persisted checkout credentials.

## Managed PIG Assets

The toolchain injects the harness-specific `update-instruction-hub`
skill into the canonical `pig` plugin for Codex and Claude. Each generated copy
is scoped to its hub's generated marketplace name, so customer-specific names,
repository URLs, and checkout locations are not hardcoded. Each hub's generated
PIG plugin receives its own scoped copy. Codex uses its marketplace upgrade and
skill refresh host operations, stopping if those current-session actions are
unavailable; Claude updates each installed plugin at its original scope and uses
`/reload-plugins` to apply the changes without restarting.

### Trace ingestion

Instruction Hubs can publish and install instructions without an ingestion worker.
New hubs created by `pig init` explicitly disable managed trace ingestion in `hub.yaml`:

```yaml
trace_ingestion:
  enabled: false
```

With ingestion disabled, the toolchain emits no managed enrollment hooks, runtime
bundle, or managed-runtime metadata. Authored skills, agents, rules, commands,
hooks, MCP configuration, and the Claude/Codex update skill remain available.
Verification and publishing do not require worker credentials or worker access.

Omitting `trace_ingestion` or `enabled` also disables ingestion. Existing hubs
that use ingestion must explicitly set `enabled: true`. Enabling ingestion
bundles the Claude, Codex, and Cursor host runtime; it does not provision a
worker. Gemini does not receive that managed runtime. See the
[Cursor collection guide](docs/cursor-trace-ingestion.md) for prerequisites,
capture limits, and desktop qualification.

For a customer worker or dashboard, configure the public HTTPS origins in the hub:

```yaml
trace_ingestion:
  enabled: true
  worker_base_url: https://pig.example.com
  dashboard_base_url: https://dashboard.example.com
  hosted_api_base_url: https://api.example.com
```

These fields are optional and default to the Promptless production endpoints.
They accept origins only: no credentials, path, query, or fragment. The toolchain
packages these settings in `hub.runtime-config.json` with each managed runtime,
so installed plugins use the hub's destinations without machine-level setup.
`PROMPTLESS_WORKER_BASE_URL`, `PROMPTLESS_DASHBOARD_BASE_URL`, and
`PROMPTLESS_HOSTED_API_BASE_URL` override their
respective packaged values when needed. Invalid packaged configuration fails
with a diagnostic instead of silently selecting another destination. These
settings contain public addresses; enrollment still requires user approval and
stores credentials locally, outside the published plugin.

After changing this setting, publish the hub and refresh its installed plugins.
Disabling it removes managed hooks from the new release; an older installed
plugin keeps its hooks until refreshed. It does not delete previously ingested
data or change a worker deployment.

### Managed Host Runtime

When `trace_ingestion.enabled` is true, the toolchain owns Promptless-managed runtime artifacts that are injected into
the canonical `pig` plugin, including the host runtime used by Codex, Claude,
and Cursor lifecycle hooks. Other generated plugins receive no toolchain-managed
runtime or lifecycle hooks. Each telemetry plugin contains prebuilt executables for
macOS arm64 and x86_64, Linux x86_64 with glibc, and Windows x86_64. Installed
managed hooks do not require Python, Node, uv, or a compiler on the user's PATH.
These are PyInstaller directory bundles containing Python 3.11 and its libraries;
they still depend on the operating system's native libraries. Linux arm64, musl,
and native Windows arm64 are not covered by this release matrix.

Claude uses an exec-form hook. Its extensionless path selects the Unix launcher
or the sibling Windows `.exe` through the host's Node/Bun process launcher.
Codex has separate POSIX and Windows PowerShell commands. Cursor uses a bundled
`.cmd` entrypoint through its POSIX shell or Windows PowerShell. Windows
qualification reproduces Cursor 3.21.9's UTF-8 input pipeline and automatic
PowerShell call operator for quoted hook paths; older host versions need qualification.
The Unix launcher uses `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/uname` to choose its bundled binary.
A missing or incomplete installed runtime requires refreshing or reinstalling
the plugin; launchers do not search other cached plugin versions.

All three hosts launch detached supervisors with closed background output pipes.
The foreground accepts bounded hook metadata and does no network or trace
collection work. Cursor additionally limits stdin waiting to 180 ms and limits
its background collector to 120 seconds. Startup hooks allow 30 seconds for
cold native startup; terminal hooks allow 3 seconds. The Claude supervisor
collects both Claude Code and detected Claude Desktop sources.

The native release workflow qualifies generated commands with an empty PATH,
paths containing spaces and Unicode, actual detached uploads, and local HTTPS.
Its matrix uses macOS 15 arm64/Intel, Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64, and Windows Server 2022
x86_64. This checks executable and shell contracts; live desktop qualification
remains separate. Windows checks both PowerShell 5.1 and 7 plus Node's
extensionless exec-form resolution.
These runner versions are qualification environments, not minimum compatible OS
versions. Older macOS and Windows releases, other glibc distributions and ABI
versions, and additional architectures require separate qualification. Packaging
a fixed native matrix narrows the platforms previously possible with a locally
installed interpreter; there is no interpreter fallback for unqualified systems.

#### Native artifact distribution

Released compiler wheels and source distributions embed a complete native bundle.
A source checkout, including the GitHub Action, downloads and caches a matching
`native-runtime.zip` from the toolchain's GitHub release named
`native-<runtime-source-sha256>`. The compiler checks the source digest, the
complete platform inventory, every file digest, and the bundle digest before
copying it into a plugin. It rejects unsafe archives, symlinks, incomplete
releases, and stale artifacts. The frozen `version`/status digest check also
validates the installed files. These integrity checks are not release signatures.

The workflow `.github/workflows/native-runtime.yml` builds and tests each platform,
assembles the complete archive, and tests a wheel built through its source
distribution. Normal CI never publishes. Every runtime asset change must have its
matching artifact published **before merging to `main`**, because source customers
may follow `main`. First bring this branch current with all other runtime changes
that will precede it, then regenerate and qualify the artifact from the exact
prospective merged runtime tree. A later asset change invalidates the promoted
hash and requires a new release. This includes the initial rollout; merging first and publishing
later leaves those builds unable to find the required artifact. The compiler fails
with instructions instead of substituting a local interpreter.

A maintainer can promote the `native-runtime-release` artifact from the fully
successful CI run for the reviewed PR commit, without first registering a workflow
on `main`. From a clean checkout of that exact commit:

```sh
reviewed_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
source_hash=$(uv run python scripts/build_native_runtime.py source-hash)
# Set reviewed_run_id to the successful CI run for reviewed_sha after reviewing its checks.
gh run view "$reviewed_run_id" --json headSha,conclusion
gh run download "$reviewed_run_id" --name native-runtime-release --dir /tmp/pig-native-release
uv run python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
from promptless_instruction_hub.native_runtime import extract_bundle, runtime_source_sha256
from promptless_instruction_hub.managed_runtime_assets.host_enrollment.promptless_host_runtime.native_bundle import validate_bundle
root = Path('/tmp/pig-native-release/validated')
extract_bundle(Path('/tmp/pig-native-release/native-runtime.zip'), root)
validate_bundle(root, source_sha256=runtime_source_sha256(), complete=True)
PY
gh release create "native-$source_hash" --target "$reviewed_sha" \
  --title "Native host runtime $source_hash" \
  --notes "Validated native artifacts for reviewed source $reviewed_sha." \
  /tmp/pig-native-release/native-runtime.zip /tmp/pig-native-release/dist/*
```

Verify the run's `headSha` equals `reviewed_sha` and its conclusion is `success`
before downloading or publishing. The hash-addressed release is immutable: do not
replace an existing release's artifacts. After the workflow exists on `main`, its
manual `publish: true` mode is available for a source hash already safe to promote.
Publishing is a separate maintainer action; neither a PR nor its CI run performs it.

For a private artifact mirror, set compiler-only
`PIG_NATIVE_RUNTIME_RELEASE_BASE_URL=https://mirror.example/releases/download`.
The mirror must serve the same `native-<source-sha256>/native-runtime.zip` layout;
the URL cannot contain credentials, a query, or a fragment. For offline builds,
set `PIG_NATIVE_RUNTIME_DIR` to an extracted, validated bundle directory.
This explicit local override may contain a subset of platforms for development;
the generated runtime manifest records exactly that subset. Do not publish a
partial development bundle as a cross-platform marketplace release.

To build and exercise a local development artifact on a supported machine:

```sh
uv run --python 3.11 --with pyinstaller==6.22.0 --with certifi==2026.7.22 python scripts/build_native_runtime.py freeze --output /tmp/pig-native
uv run python -m scripts.ci_native_runtime_smoke --bundle /tmp/pig-native
PIG_NATIVE_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/pig-native uv run pig build --hub /path/to/hub
```

Runtime source and the pinned build recipe determine the source digest. Update
`BUILD_RECIPE` when changing the freezer recipe or its pinned dependencies.
The bundle includes Mozilla CA certificates and license notices. HTTPS keeps
certificate and hostname validation enabled; explicit `SSL_CERT_FILE` or
`SSL_CERT_DIR` settings retain control of custom trust roots. Without those
overrides, bundled public roots supplement the default system/OpenSSL trust.

The host runtime uses the worker and dashboard selected above. It reads the
worker's public `/healthz` identity, opens the
hosted Promptless dashboard start URL, and listens on a loopback callback with a
per-attempt state token for the approved session proof. It then polls the hosted
runtime for a one-time per-host credential, caches that credential, and uses the
host credential to fetch `/v0/host-enrollment/policy?target=...` and post
`/v0/host-enrollment/check-ins`.

SessionStart never waits for browser approval, worker requests, trace discovery,
or the upload ledger. It launches one detached supervisor, emits and claims any
already-pending plugin-update, first-enrollment, and internal-user notices using
local state only, and returns. The supervisor runs enrollment and reconciliation
before collecting Claude Code and Claude Desktop sequentially for Claude, or the
single native source family for other hosts. On Linux, enrollment does not invoke a browser
when `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `MIR_SOCKET`, and `WSL_INTEROP` are all
absent; set `PROMPTLESS_HOST_ENROLLMENT_OPEN_BROWSER=1` to force a browser
attempt or `0` to disable one explicitly. Detached enrollment outcomes remain
available in `~/.promptless/instruction-hub/last-bootstrap-status.json` and the
bounded `host-runtime-diagnostics.jsonl` log.

#### Native trace collection

The worker's per-source watermark is authoritative after an ambiguous upload.
When a committed response is lost and the local file grows before retry, the
worker returns its watermark with a digest for the committed source range. The
runtime verifies that digest against the current local bytes, advances only to
an interior worker watermark, and rebuilds the remaining upload in the same
hook run. The local ledger also records a digest for every acknowledged prefix
so replacement or rotation at the same path cannot silently mix two source
generations. It does not reconcile gaps, rewinds, changed source identities, or
conflicts for another range. Upload requests contain one source chunk because
the worker commits one chunk per transaction; this keeps the request-level
acknowledgement at the same atomic boundary.

The runtime uploads native host transcript JSONL ranges to
`/v0/traces/batches?target=...`. Claude Code, Codex, Claude Desktop, and Cursor
share one uploader and forward-only ledger. Cursor exports saved database
observations to append-only JSONL journals before uploading. The ledger lives at
`~/.promptless/instruction-hub/host-runtime-ledger.json` or
`PROMPTLESS_HOST_RUNTIME_LEDGER` when set. Uploads use the host credential and
are gated by the `enabled_hosts` policy. Codex idle discovery scans only
`CODEX_HOME/sessions/**/*.jsonl` and
`CODEX_HOME/archived_sessions/**/*.jsonl`. Hook-provided current transcript
paths remain eligible outside those roots.

Claude and Codex SessionStart hooks launch one quiet `ensure`-then-collection supervisor. They
include active files so pre-existing history is uploaded from byte zero when a
source has no acknowledged offset. Terminal lifecycle hooks (`Stop`,
`SessionEnd`, and `SubagentStop`) run collection only. Hook input accepts
snake_case, camelCase, and nested
`session`/`transcript`/`agent` transcript references from Codex- and
Claude-style hooks. Claude Desktop has no hook-provided current transcript and
starts with idle catch-up.

Hook timeouts cover the launcher, while collection runs in a detached process.
Claude and Codex terminal hooks use a 3-second launcher budget, which also fits
Codex's `SessionEnd` maximum. Startup hooks use 30 seconds. Cursor uses the
same startup and terminal budgets.

A collection follows this order:

```text
upload at most one pending current-transcript request
    -> start a fresh 25-second catch-up deadline
    -> upload remaining current-transcript ranges
    -> scan and upload idle transcripts
```

The first pending current-transcript request receives its own fixed 25-second
deadline before the catch-up clock starts. Contention or exhausting that budget
reports `trace_upload_partial` for a later hook to resume. Remaining current-
transcript work, idle discovery, and idle uploads share the fresh catch-up
deadline, configurable with
`PROMPTLESS_HOST_RUNTIME_COLLECT_DEADLINE_SECONDS`.

Each request is one ledger transaction:

```text
lock -> reload ledger -> select request -> post -> validate acknowledgement
     -> persist acknowledged offsets -> unlock
```

Policy reads and transcript-root scans run without the ledger lock. The ledger
advances only after the worker acknowledges the exact source ranges and content
hashes. Releasing and reloading the ledger between requests preserves progress
from other collectors. When the catch-up deadline expires, collection
reports `trace_upload_partial` and resumes from the acknowledged offsets on a
later hook.

Source ranges target 4 MiB and end on complete-record boundaries. Serialized
requests target 6 MiB and never exceed 10 MiB; sizing includes chunks and request
metadata. Each batch carries the currently installed `plugin_version`, which is
treated as the version associated with every byte in that batch.

#### Collection safety

An unseen source starts at byte zero. A known source resumes at its last
worker-acknowledged offset, including offsets written by earlier runtime
versions. Plugin updates immediately use the new collection code, but do not
rewind those existing offsets; intentionally skipped prefixes therefore remain
grandfathered unless the ledger is reset. Obsolete baseline and release-marker
fields are discarded when an older ledger is next rewritten.

Collection runs detached from the hook process group. Quiet collection writes
no status JSON to hook stdout. A source that vanishes or loses read permission
mid-collect is recorded as drift and surfaced through `unreadable_source_count`;
it does not block later sources. Support diagnostics are bounded, redacted JSONL
at `~/.promptless/instruction-hub/host-runtime-diagnostics.jsonl` with `0600`
permissions and no transcript content, tool inputs, or credentials. Detached
launch and nonzero-exit failures are also recorded in the structured
`last-bootstrap-status.json` support status.

Host enrollment is per host, not per installed `pig` version. The credential
and pending approval are cached at a single host-global path
(`~/.promptless/instruction-hub/`) and keyed only on the worker deployment and
agent host (claude/codex). A non-blocking, per-credential enrollment-leader lock
ensures that overlapping host starts or plugin upgrades drive at most one browser
approval while the others reuse the result or defer to a later session. The
per-plugin `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`/`PLUGIN_DATA` directories are intentionally not
used for this state.

Native JSONL ledgers are the only telemetry source: the runtime writes no OTel
exporter config for either host. Hosts configured by earlier managed bootstraps
have that config removed on the next `ensure` run — the managed `[otel]` block
in Codex `config.toml` and the marker-owned `OTEL_*`/telemetry env keys in
Claude `settings.json` are deleted (with a timestamped backup), while unmanaged
user config is never touched. The hosted policy's legacy `collector` section is
ignored.

The host runtime has one executable entrypoint with subcommands. `session-start`
detaches one `ensure`-then-collection supervisor. `ensure` enrolls when needed,
removes legacy managed telemetry config, and posts a check-in. `collect` is the
native JSONL upload path; hooks pass `--detach` so the runtime supervises
collection outside the hook process group. Pass `--include-active` for a
user-initiated sweep that includes files still inside the idle grace period.
`enroll` acquires only
the host credential. `status` prints local JSON without network,
browser, config writes, or check-ins. `reset --yes` clears cached host
credentials and pending enrollments while preserving the stable host id,
last-seen plugin versions, and one internal welcome marker per installed
marketplace version. `version` reports runtime metadata.

For an SSH session, remote workstation, or other headless machine, run the
installed runtime directly:

```sh
/path/to/pig/runtime/promptless-host-runtime enroll --host codex --device
```

Use `claude` or `cursor` for those hosts. The command prints an approval link to
stderr that you can open on another device, then polls for about 35 seconds.
It needs no local browser, inbound port, or loopback callback. If its JSON result
is `setup_pending`, approve the link and run the same command again; it resumes
the saved session until the 15-minute approval expires. After expiry, the next
run creates a new approval. Concurrent enrollment commands share one session.
Credentials stay in the local host state and are never printed. `enroll` only
obtains the credential; the next `ensure` or lifecycle hook reconciles the host.

Device enrollment requires the hosted API's
`POST /v1/instruction-hub/host-enrollments/device-sessions` endpoint. Custom
installations must configure `hosted_api_base_url` as well as their worker and
dashboard origins. Approval still requires membership in the deployment's
organization. Disabling automatic browser launch alone does not enable this flow.

Hosted policy verification is unchanged: the runtime trusts the authenticated
TLS worker response and validates the policy shape. Native packaging does not
add asymmetric policy signatures.
